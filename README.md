## Quick start

1. First, you need to add a tag where you want to display the map, with a custom identifier.
Optionally, you can add tags with class `traveledmap-trip-step` and `data-step` attribute to define the step's anchors.
```html
<div id="traveledmap-trip-map" />

<div class="traveledmap-trip-step" data-step="my-step-1-hash">
<div class="traveledmap-trip-step" data-step="my-step-2-hash">
```
    
2. Then include the library files to load the Javascript and CSS:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/traveledmap/trip-embedder-js@latest/dist/traveledmap-trip.min.js" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/traveledmap/trip-embedder-js@latest/dist/traveledmap-trip.min.css" />
```

3. Finally, instantiate the trip so that the map can display. Don't forget to use your custom id and to check the
   [configuration options](#config)
```html
<script>
    const onLoad = function() {
        new TraveledMapTrip('traveledmap-trip-map', config);
    }
    
    if (window.addEventListener) {
        window.addEventListener("load", onLoad, false);
    } else if (window.attachEvent) { // IE DOM
        window.attachEvent("onload", onLoad);
    } else {
        onLoad();
    }
</script>
```

## Config

## Examples
The example folder contains 4 HTML files that you can open with your browser:
 - `extendable.html` embeds a sticky map in the website's right column, that is extended outside its container, to the top,
   right and bottom of the screen.
 - `stretchable.html` embeds a sticky map in the page's text flow (representing an itinerary detail), which can be stretched
   or hidden.
 - `static.html` embeds a static map at the top of the trip itinerary's description
 - `responsive.html` embeds two sticky maps. One in the page's flow on mobile and tablet, when the 
right column isn't visible, and one in the right column on screens larger than mobiles and tablets.

<details id="difference-expand-stretch">
    <summary>What's the difference between expanded and stretched?</summary>

    Both expand and stretch will increase the area covered by the map, but stretch will just
    heighten (increase the height) when expand will expand outside the map's container to the
    screen limits provided in the configuration (top, right, bottom, left).
